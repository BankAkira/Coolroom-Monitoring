# Coolroom-Monitoring
Cool room Monitoring System (CMS) was a research topic under Horticulture Innovation Lab Regional Center at Kasetsart University (2012-2019). Under the research, there are 3 models: Online version, Offline version and SMS warning system.

Objective and usage
Cool room uses electricity that raises cost of the produce. Learning the environmental condition surrounding cool room and behavior of using it such as the frequency of opening and closing door, duration of door opening and the cooling time of the produce will help them improve power use efficiency and safe cost. 
Online CMS helps user to check their cool room is still running well or not anywhere in the world. If something happen such as door opened too long or temperature is too high, user will know immediately and go fix the problem and save their produce in time. The system cannot controlling anything, just monitoring and warning.
